Hi I am a first year Software Engineering student studying at University Of Leicester. I am highly motivated in software hence why I explored areas like OOP, tkinter and pygame mechanics. Becoming a Cisco Certified Network Associate(CCNA) enhanced my networking skills as well as my communication skills as one of the modules was based on communication with colleagues in order to create a working topology.
